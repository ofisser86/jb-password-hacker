<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
  <p>Imagine that you are doing analytics for some manufacturer.</p> 
  <p>You collected the data for the past several months. Production costs for each month are stored in the <code class="java">costs</code> list, while total revenues per month are collected in a list called <code class="java">revenues</code>. Finally, the names of the months the data was collected in are stored in the <code class="java">months</code> list.</p> 
  <p>Compute and print out the profit of the manufacturer for each month. The output should look as follows:</p> 
  <p>Jan 1000<br> Feb 1500<br> etc.</p> 
  <p><button class="btn-sm btn-outline-secondary" onclick="getElementById('hint-601').style.display='inline'"> Hint </button> </p>
  <div id="hint-601" style="display:none;">
    Profit is defined as the difference between revenue and production costs 
  </div>
  <p></p>
