 <body>
  <p>Given two equally-sized vectors <code class="java">v1</code> and <code class="java">v2</code>, calculate their vector sum by adding their coordinates element-wise. The vectors will always be of the same dimension. Print out each obtained coordinate on a new line, for example, for <code class="java">v1 = (1, 5)</code> and <code class="java">v2 = (2, 3)</code>, the result will be as follows:</p> 
  <p><samp>3<br> 8</samp></p> 
  <p>Assume that the tuples <code class="java">v1</code> and <code class="java">v2</code> have been defined in advance and are ready to use.</p>
